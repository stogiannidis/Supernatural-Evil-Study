### Belief in Supernatural Evil Metric

In order to measure the belief in supernatural evil, we will use the answers to three questions asked by the participants in the survey:

* Whether the respondent believes in hell.

* Whether the respondent believes in demons.

You will investigate how the answers to these three questions can be combined to a single metric. Justify your approach.
